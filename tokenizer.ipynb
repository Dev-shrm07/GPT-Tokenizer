    "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. A subject of widespread public interest with a vast fanbase, she has influenced the music industry, popular culture and politics through her artistry, songwriting, entrepreneurship, and advocacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift began professional songwriting at age 14. She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Their singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats and brought Swift mainstream fame. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on her next albums, Speak Now (2010) and Red (2012), respectively, with the latter featuring her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". Swift recalibrated her image from country to pop with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album containing the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the eclectic pop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). She explored indie folk styles on the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, subdued electropop on Midnights (2022), and re-recorded four albums subtitled Taylor's Version[a] after a dispute with Big Machine. These albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\", and \"Is It Over Now?\". Her Eras Tour (2023–2024) and its accompanying concert film became the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time, respectively. Her 2024 record, The Tortured Poets Department, was a double album. Swift has directed videos and films such as Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and has also acted in films.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift is one of the world's best-selling artists, with 200 million records sold worldwide as of 2019. She is the most-streamed artist on Spotify, the highest-grossing female touring act, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. Six of her albums have opened with over one million sales in a week. The 2023 Time Person of the Year, Swift has appeared on lists such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, and Forbes' World's 100 Most Powerful Women. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 39 Billboard Music Awards, and 23 MTV Video Music Awards; she has won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year a record four times each.\n",

    "Early life\n",
    "Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch; her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked for a time as a mutual fund marketing executive.[3] Her younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[4] Swift's maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[5] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[3] Swift's mother is of Scottish and German descent, and her father is of Scottish and English descent with distant Italian ancestry.[6][7]\n",

    "Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[8] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[9] She was raised Christian[10] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[11][12] When her family moved to Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[13][14] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[15] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[16] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[12] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[17][18] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[19]\n",
    "\n",
    "At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[20] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[21] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[22] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[23] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[24][25] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[26][27] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[28] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[29][30]\n",

    "2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\n",
    "In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[31][32] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[33] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[34] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[35] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[25][18] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[36]\n",

    "At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[38] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[25] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[39][40] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[18] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[41] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[42][43] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[44]\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[45] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[46] as a replacement for Eric Church.[47] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[45][26]\n",
    "\n",
    "Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[48] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[49][50][51] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[52][53] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[54] Brad Paisley,[55] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[56]\n",

    "Genres\n",
    "Swift has reinvented her musical identity with each album release,[237] earning descriptions as a musical \"chameleon\" from Time and the BBC.[238][239] In her early career, her musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[240] and the country crossover music of Keith Urban, which incorporated rock, pop, and blues.[241] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift (2006) to Red (2012).[242][243] The albums featured country signifiers such as banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, but music critics noted their pop melodies and rock influences;[244][245] for example, Speak Now (2010) drew on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[93][246][247] Swift's country-music identity received contrarian commentary; critics argued that country was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[248][249] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[250][251] The music journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[252]\n",
    "\n",
    "After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[253][254] 1989 (2014) was the first album in this direction, incorporating dense synthesizers and electronic arrangements.[255] Swift expanded on the electronic production on Reputation (2017), Lover (2019), and Midnights (2022), incorporating other pop styles such as pop rock, electropop, and dream pop.[198][256] On each album, she also experimented with other genres: Reputation consisted of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[156] Lover featured a 1980s-influenced synth-driven production;[172] and Midnights was characterized by a minimalist, subdued sound.[257] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity.[258] Others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[259][260] The music critic Ann Powers opined that Swift has created her own genre \"by blending country's sturdy song structures with R&B's vibes, rap's cadences and pop's glitz\".[261]\n",
    "\n",
    "Her 2020 pandemic albums Folklore and Evermore explored alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, which resulted in a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[262][263] The latter further experimented with varied song structures, time signatures, and instruments.[264] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[263]\n",

    "Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[269] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[270][271] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[272] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[273] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[274] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[275]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[276] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[277] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[278][156][279] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[280]\n",

    "Reviews of Swift's later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[245][281][282] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[283][284][285] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[286] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[287][288][289] An i review said Swift's voice is \"leagues better now\".[290] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift's voice,[291] and that her country twang faded away.[292] Midnights received acclaim for Swift's nuanced vocal delivery.[293] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[271] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals.[294] The musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift's timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[295]\n",
    "\n",
    "Songwriting\n",
    "Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[296][297] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[298] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[17][102] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[299] Joni Mitchell;[300] and Fall Out Boy.[301] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[26][302] Her literary influences included the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[303] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[304] the lattermost of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[305]\n",
    "\n",
    "In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[26] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[306][307] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[308][309] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[93][310] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[311] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[253] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[312] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[313] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[314][315] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[297][316]\n",
    "\n",
    "Her confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[317][26][318] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[319][320][321] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[322][323] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[156] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[323] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[26] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[324][325][326] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[327]\n",
    "\n",
    "On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[328] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[308] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[328] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[329] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[330]\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[331] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[332] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[333] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[334] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[201] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[335]\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[336][337][338] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare among her peers.[339][340] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[341][330] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[342] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[343]\n",

       "'\\n\\nTaylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. A subject of widespread public interest with a vast fanbase, she has influenced the music industry, popular culture and politics through her artistry, songwriting, entrepreneurship, and advocacy.\\n\\nSwift began professional songwriting at age 14. She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Their singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats and brought Swift mainstream fame. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on her next albums, Speak Now (2010) and Red (2012), respectively, with the latter featuring her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". Swift recalibrated her image from country to pop with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album containing the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\".

With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[23] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[24][25] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch\\'s Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[26][27] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[28] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[29][30]\\n\\n2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[31][32] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[33] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[34] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I\\'ve ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She\\'d write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she\\'d come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[35] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label\\'s lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people\\'s stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[25][18] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[36]\\n\\nTaylor Swift singing on a microphone and playing a guitar\\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[37]\\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville\\'s Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[38] She was one of Big Machine\\'s first signings,[25] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[39][40] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[18] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[41] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[42][43] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a US platinum-certified debut album.[44]\\n\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations. As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[45] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[46] as a replacement for Eric Church.[47] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[45][26]\\n\\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should\\'ve Said No\".

Media outlets extensively covered the tour\\'s cultural and economic impact,[226] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[201] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour\\'s ticket sales.[227] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history, collecting over $1 billion.[228] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[229][230] Swift\\'s music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[231] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" in 2023.[232] Swift also won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[233]\\n\\nSwift began dating American football player Travis Kelce in 2023.[234] In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to X (formerly Twitter) and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[235] At the 66th Grammy Awards, Swift announced her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, released on April 19, 2024.[210] A double album edition, subtitled The Anthology, was surprise-released on the same day, containing 15 additional songs.[236]\\n\\nArtistry\\nGenres\\nSwift has reinvented her musical identity with each album release,[237] earning descriptions as a musical \"chameleon\" from Time and the BBC.[238][239] In her early career, her musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[240] and the country crossover music of Keith Urban, which incorporated rock, pop, and blues.[241] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift (2006) to Red (2012).[242][243] The albums featured country signifiers such as banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, but music critics noted their pop melodies and rock influences;[244][245] for example, Speak Now (2010) drew on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[93][246][247] Swift\\'s country-music identity received contrarian commentary; critics argued that country was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[248][249] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[250][251] The music journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[252]\\n\\nAfter the critical debate around Red\\'s eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[253][254] 1989 (2014) was the first album in this direction, incorporating dense synthesizers and electronic arrangements.[255] Swift expanded on the electronic production on Reputation (2017), Lover (2019), and Midnights (2022), incorporating other pop styles such as pop rock, electropop, and dream pop.[198][256] On each album, she also experimented with other genres: Reputation consisted of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[156] Lover featured a 1980s-influenced synth-driven production;[172] and Midnights was characterized by a minimalist, subdued sound.[257] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity.[258] Others regarded it as necessary for Swift\\'s artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[259][260] The music critic Ann Powers opined that Swift has created her own genre \"by blending country\\'s sturdy song structures with R&B\\'s vibes, rap\\'s cadences and pop\\'s glitz\".[261]\\n\\nHer 2020 pandemic albums Folklore and Evermore explored alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, which resulted in a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[262][263] The latter further experimented with varied song structures, time signatures, and instruments.[264] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift\\'s artistry as a singer-songwriter.[263]\\n\\nVoice\\n\\n\"Our Song\" (2006)\\nDuration: 17 seconds.0:17\\nSwift sings with a Southern accent and a light country twang in her early songs such as \"Our Song\".[265][266]\\n\"Cardigan\" (2020)\\nDuration: 22 seconds.0:22\\nSwift uses her lower register in \"Cardigan\".[267]\\n\"Lavender Haze\" (2022)\\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\\n\"Lavender Haze\" features Swift\\'s falsetto vocals in the refrain.[268]\\nProblems playing these files? See media help.\\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range,[269] and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[270][271] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries.[272] Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[273] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\".[274] They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.[275]\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift\\'s defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[276] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[277] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[278][156][279] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[280]\\n\\nReviews of Swift\\'s later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[245][281][282] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[283][284][285] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[286] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[287][288][289] An i review said Swift\\'s voice is \"leagues better now\".[290] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift\\'s voice,[291] and that her country twang faded away.[292] Midnights received acclaim for Swift\\'s nuanced vocal delivery.[293] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[271] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift\\'s live vocals.[294] The musicologist Alyssa Barna said that Swift\\'s timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in her upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[295]\\n\\nSongwriting\\nSwift\\'s fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[296][297] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[298] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[17][102] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[299] Joni Mitchell;[300] and Fall Out Boy.[301] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[26][302] Her literary influences included the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[303] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[304] the lattermost of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[305]\\n\\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[26] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[306][307] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[308][309] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[93][310] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[311] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[253] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift\\'s fame,[312] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[313] Other themes in Swift\\'s music include family dynamics, friendship,[314][315] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[297][316]\\n\\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[317][26][318] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[319][320][321] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[322][323] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[156] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[323] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[26] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[324][325][326] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[327]\\n\\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[328] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[308] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[328] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[329] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[330]\\n\\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[331] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" of the album.[332] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers\\' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[333] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[334] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[201] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You\\'re Anything Like Me\".[335]\\n\\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters ever by several publications.[336][337][338] Literature scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and writing style are rare among her peers.[339][340] Swift\\'s bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[341][330] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[342] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[343]\\n\\nPerformances\\nFurther information: List of Taylor Swift live performances\\nSwift singing while playing a piano\\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018\\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best live performers. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[344][345][346][347][348] Swift commands large audiences,[349][350][351] without having to rely on dance like her contemporaries do.[352] According to V magazine\\'s Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[353] In a 2008 review of Swift\\'s early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd\\'s energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[354] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[355] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[356]\\n\\nCritics have highlighted Swift\\'s versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[357][358] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[359] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[360] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[361] acoustic guitar; piano;[362] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[363][364] banjo,[365] or ukulele.[366] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[294][367] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[368][362] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop\\'s most approachable superstar\",[369] and the 21st century\\'s most popular performer.[370]\\n\\nVideo and film\\nFurther information: Taylor Swift videography\\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[371] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[372] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[373] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn\\'t in the scenes.\"[374]\\n\\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift\\'s involvement.[375] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[376] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[377]\\n\\nHer production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[378] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[379] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[380] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[201] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[381] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[371]\\n\\nAccolades and achievements\\nFurther information: List of awards and

marketing tool,[25][45] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[476][252] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[477] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[478][479]\\n\\nAccording to
